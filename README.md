# Alarm-O-Clock

The project is an alarm clock that can tell the time, day of week, date, and weather, and set off a programmable alarm. The time, date, day, and temperature are all read from a real time clock. Through the menu, the temperature can be changed between F and C, time can be changed between 12 hours and 24 hours, and an alarm can be set. The alarm is turned off by the heartbeat sensor sensing a heartbeat.
